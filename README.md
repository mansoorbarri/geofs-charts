# GeoFS Charts
get airport charts on any airport just by the ICAO code. 

## setup 
- install [tempermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/)
- copy [main.js](/main.js) to tempermonkey 
- reload GeoFS 

## use the addon
- you will see a search icon on the right side of the page
- click on it and enter a ICAO code
- it will display the chart and you can open it in a new window or download it

If a chart is missing, feel free to open a [issue](https://github.com/mansoorbarri/geofs-charts/issues) or ping me on discord @xyzmani.
